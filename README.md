## Product Direction

**Target:** Bootstrapped SaaS founders (2–20 person teams) struggling with consistent social media presence while building their products.

**Core Insight:** Small SaaS founders are builders, not marketers. They know they need social presence but lack time, skills, and consistency. SocialConnect provides opinionated automation that removes decision paralysis while maintaining authenticity.

**Promise:** Go from 3 sporadic posts/month → 15+ posts/month, in just 10 minutes/week.

### Key Differentiators
- **One-Click SaaS Onboarding** — 5-minute guided setup generates a 30-day content calendar in your voice
- **SaaS-Specific Templates** — Build-in-public, product updates, milestone celebrations, founder journey
- **AI Content with Human Checkpoints** — AI proposes variations, you quickly approve/edit
- **Founder Voice Training** — System learns your tone from real posts, passes the "did I write this?" test
- **30-Day Content Runway Guarantee** — Auto-refill keeps your queue always stocked

## Features

- Schedule posts to 28+ social channels (LinkedIn, X, Instagram, TikTok, and more)
- Drag-and-drop calendar to manage all posts
- Per-channel analytics and performance insights
